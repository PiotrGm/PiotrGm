ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Piotr Gmerek.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about Python programming, Raspberry Pi, 3D modeling, and some fun robotics projects.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into Python, working with Raspberry Pi, experimenting with 3D printing, and playing around with cool DIY electronics (like LEDs stuff and small gadgets).

ðŸ“« How to reach me? --> gmerekgmerek@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact (for me): Iâ€™m a sound engineer by trade, but once I discovered the endless possibilities in tech and electronics, I couldnâ€™t stop exploring. Now Iâ€™m building, printing, and programming my own creations.
